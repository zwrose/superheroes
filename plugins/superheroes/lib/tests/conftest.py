    """#121 safety net: NO test may touch (or rename, via migrate_store_root) the developer's real
    ~/.claude store — including tests that spawn a SUBPROCESS (which re-imports the lib fresh, so an
    in-process constant monkeypatch wouldn't reach it). Pin the store root via the env var, which
    IS inherited by subprocesses. Using the legacy WORKHORSE_STORE_ROOT means a test that sets its
    own WORKHORSE_/SUPERHEROES_ env (or delenvs them) still wins — it applies after this fixture.

    Also pin the managed-worktree root: without this, any test (or node smoke inheriting os.environ)
    that reaches buildtree does a real `git worktree add` into the developer's ~/.superheroes-worktrees
    — one orphaned checkout per unique tmp-repo path, accumulating every run and never cleaned. Isolating
    it here (mirroring the store root) keeps every test's worktrees inside tmp_path. A test that sets its
    own SUPERHEROES_WORKTREES_ROOT still wins (applies after this fixture)."""
