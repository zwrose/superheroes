# Transition notes

This file records **consumer-visible shape changes** across plugin releases, newest release first.
Add an entry here whenever a release changes a contract that callers, orchestrators, or downstream
tools read — return shapes, artifact filenames, dispatch channels, or validation rules. Internal
refactors that leave every consumer-facing field unchanged do not belong here.

## Unreleased

### `run_loop` never certifies

`round_driver.run_loop` **never returns a certified receipt.** Consumers reading `receipt["verdict"]`
on the library return get a refusal shape instead: class `unrun-review`, artifact
`driver-journal.jsonl`, plus `loopTerminal` / `loopCertificationShape` / `loopRounds` for loop
observability. The loop still runs; only the certification answer is always a refusal.

### Head-content blobs (`head-content-blobs/2`)

`head-content-blobs.json` is now schema **`head-content-blobs/2`**. The keys `present` and
`fixCommits` are gone; the file carries `schema`, `files` (base64 of the raw bytes read at the
head), and `reads` (one row per read, with `contentDigest`, `bytes`, `readAt`, `source`,
`readError`).

A **legacy-shape blob is refused, not reinterpreted.** A session written before this change refuses
certification of its `fixed` dispositions with binding failure `fix-content-schema-unsupported`.
Silently reinterpreting the old shape could flip a resumed session's certification outcome on a
plugin upgrade alone. A resumed pre-upgrade session must be re-run to certify its fixed
dispositions.

### Certification receipt artifact

At a terminal, the driver now writes a **certification artifact** beside `round-receipt.json`:

- **Success** — `certification-receipt.json`: carries `terminalState`, `terminalCause`, per-seat
  provenance in `seats`, the `disclosures` block (`importantOutOfScope`), and each finding's
  disposition plus its disposition proof (`dispositionReceipt` where applicable).
- **Refusal** — `certification-refusal.json`: names one of the four escape classes
  (`unrun-review`, `same-family-seat`, `unfetched-findings`, `disposition-without-receipt`) and the
  artifact that failed.

`round-receipt.json` and `validate_receipt` are **unchanged** — same required keys, same validator,
same handback gate vocabulary. The certification artifact is separate machinery produced by
`round_certification.certify`.

**`certificationShape` rule (writer receipt only).** Any hand-landed seat forces
`audited-chain`, never `full-panel-confirmed` (and any `full-panel*` shape in loop state is
downgraded the same way). The driver's `round-receipt.json` still records the loop's own shape;
only the certification receipt applies this override.

### `run_loop` return contract

`round_driver.run_loop` returns the certification writer's **refusal** directly — always class
`unrun-review`, artifact `driver-journal.jsonl` — plus `loopTerminal`, `loopCertificationShape`,
and `loopRounds`. There is no fallback to a legacy `build_receipt`-only dict and no certified
receipt on the library path.

| Outcome | What you get | How to read it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Library `run_loop` return | Refusal dict with `class: "unrun-review"`, `artifact: "driver-journal.jsonl"`, plus `loopTerminal`, `loopCertificationShape`, `loopRounds` | No `verdict` key — discriminate on `class`, not `receipt["verdict"]`. `loopTerminal` is what the loop reached; it asserts nothing about certification. |
| Writer fault | Refusal dict with `class: "writer-fault"` | Internal writer crash or empty return during materialization; not one of the four escape classes. |

**Migration.** Callers that tested `receipt["verdict"]` on the `run_loop` return must branch on
`class`, not `verdict`:

```python
result = run_loop(seams, config)
if "class" in result:
    # always unrun-review on the library path — use result.get("loopTerminal") for loop observability
    ...
```

### Codex dispatch channel

Codex review and write dispatches now run with **`--json`** and **`--output-last-message`**. Engagement
is read from codex's own JSONL event stream (`engagement.source` is `codex-events` when tool-call
telemetry parses). The review findings payload is read from the **last-message file**
(`codex_review_payload_text`); the event stream's last `agent_message` item is the fallback when the
file is absent.

Consumers that parsed review output from codex stdout must read the last-message file (or the
structured event stream) instead of treating raw stdout as the findings payload.
